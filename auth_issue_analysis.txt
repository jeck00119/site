The authentication issue has multiple causes:

1. INCONSISTENT AUTHENTICATION:
   - /configurations endpoints: NO authentication required
   - /image_source endpoints: NO authentication required
   - /component endpoints: REQUIRES authentication

2. TOKEN EXPIRATION ISSUE:
   - tryLogin() had a bug where it would fail if tokenExpiration was null
   - This has been fixed to check for all required auth data

3. RECOMMENDATION:
   - Either add authentication to ALL endpoints
   - OR remove authentication from /component endpoints
   - For consistency and security, all data endpoints should require auth
